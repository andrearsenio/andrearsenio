# Welcome to my Github!

# Who am I?

My name is André, I was born and raised in Portugal, I lived and worked for 9+ years in the Netherlands and 4 years in Mozambique. I am currently based in Lisboa. I have a dog.

# What do I do?

I am an engineer and a researcher who really likes data - does not have to be Big -, beautiful plots and mathematical models - does not have to be AI. I like to use all this to support decision making and enable more sustainable water and sanitation services. That's what I did in the Netherlands, that's what I did in Mozambique, that's what I do now, in Portugal: maybe the scope and the approach were different, and adapted to the local context, but the final goal has always been the same.
