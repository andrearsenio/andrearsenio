# Who am I?

My name is Andr√©, I was born and raised in Portugal, I lived and worked for 9+ years in the Netherlands and 4 years in Mozambique. I am currently based in Lisboa. 

# What do I do?

I am an engineer and a researcher who really likes data - does not have to be big -, beautiful plots and mathematical models - does not have to be AI. I like to use all this to support decision making and enable more sustainable water and sanitation services. That's what I did in the Netherlands, that's what I did in Mozambique, and that's what I do now, in Portugal. Throughout my working experience, the approaches changed and were adapted to the local contexts, but the final goal has remained unchanged. 

I currently work at [AGS Water Solutions](https://www.ags.pt/) where I do extensive work on strategic asset management, particularly in developing lifetime prediction models and (long-term) investment plans for drinking water infrastructure. 

# What do I work with?

I started coding on Matlab but ever since I found [R language](https://www.r-project.org/) and [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) I never looked back. The packages that I use the most include:

- Data processing: [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)
- Dashboards and communication: [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
- Plotting: [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). Here I should say that ggplot is the best and most advanced data visualization suite that I have ever had the pleasure of using 
- Maps: [R spatial](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/)
- Mathematical modelling: [survival](https://cran.r-project.org/package=survival), [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [survival xgboost](https://rdrr.io/github/IyarLin/survXgboost/), [random survival forests](https://www.randomforestsrc.org/)
